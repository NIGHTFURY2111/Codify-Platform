# Differential_equations
 
The repository contains "Numerical methods" - Differential equations

Details can be found in the Wiki section of this repository.


<details><summary>What are the possibilities:</summary>

  1. Solving the differential equation using the Euler method
  2. Solving the DE using the Euler-Cauchy method
  3. Solving the DE using the Runge-Kutta method
  4. coming soon...
